                Here on Melanie Daveid's website, I can see how he managed to make use of a grey background than black to create a shadow that we can view as a hand due to the contrast. The presence of small white dots is noticed which is also in contrast to the black
                hand. Lastly, his name is written in a modern stylish fashion in white which we all know is a perfect contrast to black colour.

                Academic earth makes use of Visual Hierarchy here on their front page. As I loaded the page, my attention was drawn to the phrase "Rethink Education" because of its size which gave it a level of importance. Immediately I tried looking away, I was instantly
                drawn to the play button which was looking attractive to click on, it felt important after I left the big size above.

                Kodable is a programming website for kids that has many great web design practices and one of which is alignment. It's obvious how the vertical alignment of the website adds a sense of arrangement and balance to the page. The horizontal alignment used
                to differentiate the sections also look great and has helped a great deal in their presentation for children. Simple alignment the layout good.
